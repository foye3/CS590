Lectures will take the form of a video posting each week discussing a particular topic. The lectures will often correlate to a section of the textbook, but may convey additional information or entire topics not found in the book. You are responsible for knowing the material discussed in the video.

The lecture material will be broken up into several units. At the end of each unit, an assignment will be given out to the class. Assignments must be completed in a group of 3-4 people, all of whom must be from the same section. You will have several weeks to complete each assignment. Assignments count for 75% of the total course grade. Each assignment group is also required to present their work on a minimum of one assignment to the class as a whole via Blackboard Collaborate, so that students may benefit from seeing each others' work and solutions to the assignment. You may volunteer to present a particular assignment, but if there are no volunteers I will choose from the pool of groups that have not yet presented any assignments. If you miss your assigned presentation, whether or not you volunteered for that presentation, your grade on the assignment will be reduced by 40 points.

If you score less than a 75% on any assignment (but not on labs), your group may elect to resubmit your assignment. You will lose 25 points by taking advantage of this opportunity. If you submit an assignment up to one week late, you also will lose 25 points and will not be able to resubmit it. Assignments submitted after one week will receive no credit. 

All work must be submitted by the end of the semester, even for no credit, in order to pass the course.

Language and Environment

This semester, you will be taught using a combination of JavaScript and TypeScript. You may, however, choose to use a different rigorous object oriented programming language for your assignments if you can get the graders or course assistants to agree to grade that language and environment. You may automatically assume that C# 6, VB.NET 14, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and C++ are all acceptable without asking ahead of time. If you are using C# or VB.NET you must use Visual Studio 2015 to compile and test. If you are using C++, you must use GNU G++ version 4.8.4. If you are using JavaScript, you must be programming in ES6 with Node.js version 6.1.0. If you use TypeScript, you must be using version 1.8.10. Java should be programmed against JDK 7.
